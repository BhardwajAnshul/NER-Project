# Project: Named Entity Recognition
## Team Members: Rachit Jain & Anshul Bhardwaj
### Problem Statement
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the most popular applications of Natural Language Processing. For the scope of this project, we will focus on creating a NER model that identifies key tokens and classifies them into set of predefined entities.

The number of scientific papers published per year has exploded in recent years, strengthening its value as one of the main drivers for scientific progress. In astronomy alone, more than 41,000 new articles are published every year and the vast majority are available either via an open-access model or via pre-print services. Indexing the articleâ€™s full-text in search engines helps discover and retrieve vital scientific information to continue building on the shoulders of giants, informing policy, and making evidence-based decisions. Nevertheless, it is difficult to navigate in this ocean of data; finding articles rely heavily on string matching searches and following citations/references. NER helps us extract key information from scientific papers which can help search engines to better select and filter articles.

### Learning Objectives
For this, you will first train a language model on WIESP dataset. Define and train a simple RNN network with 2 RNN layers as your baseline model. Using the knowledge learned during the duration of this, come up with an algorithm that outperforms the baseline. The goal is to flex your AI3 muscles so we expect a tonne of experimentation with different models and architectures.
